# Iris — ActivityPub .NET Libraries

A set of .NET libraries for ActivityPub, designed to be embedded in existing apps and services.

**This file is the single live operating document.** It is the only thing an autonomous agent needs to read to know what's happening now and what's next; everything else in `docs/` is either a rarely-touched reference or a write-once archive. See [docs/reference/AUTONOMOUS_LOOP.md](docs/reference/AUTONOMOUS_LOOP.md) for the loop this file drives.

## Short version

- Clean, focused abstractions; no framework lock-in beyond .NET.
- One client, two directions: a single `net10.0` client used by both client apps and server-to-server flows.
- Server capability added to ASP.NET Core via `IServiceCollection` and `IApplicationBuilder` extensions.
- ActivityStreams is provided by `KristofferStrube.ActivityStreams`; Iris adds identity, signing, validation, and IRI helpers on top.
- Actor-keyed auth allows a client to fetch an actor document, then sign requests using that actor's private key.
- Community-aware by default, with Group-like actors and unified feed/collection APIs.
- API access uses versioned routes under `/ap/v1/...` and `iris:`-namespaced capabilities.
- Integration-first test model with multi-instance `TestServer` harnesses, not a sprawling unit-test suite.

## Conventions

- Target framework: `net10.0` everywhere.
- `System.Text.Json` is the serialization surface; ActivityStreams/ActivityPub objects come from the third-party package model.
- Dependency flow: `Iris.Core` -> ActivityStreams + BCL; `Iris.Client` depends on `Iris.Core`; `Iris.Server` depends on `Iris.Core` + `Iris.Client` + ASP.NET Core.
- Caching is explicit: every read path that is cached exposes a `bypassCache` escape hatch.
- Versioned endpoints and `iris:` capability terms are authoritative.
- Testing is integration-first and browser-assisted where UI behavior matters.

## Test runs (fast vs. full)

- **Fast (default for the loop):** `dotnet test --filter "Category!=Slow"` — excludes the slow tests (those that wait out a real delivery backoff budget). Use this for the everyday "is it green?" check.
- **Full (source of truth):** `dotnet test` — every test including the slow ones. Use for the final green check before a phase closes.
- To mark a test slow: `[Trait(TestCategories.Category, TestCategories.Slow)]` (constants in `Iris.Testing.TestCategories`). Only mark tests that wait on real wall-clock time. Details + honest payoff note: [docs/reference/TESTING.md §Running the suite: fast vs. full](docs/reference/TESTING.md#running-the-suite-fast-vs-full).

## Now

**Phase 54 — Post-1.0 polish & hardening (IN PROGRESS).** 54.1 (full manual Playwright regression pass) COMPLETE — 5 defects fixed. 54.2 (empty/loading-state consistency audit) COMPLETE — states verified consistent; all 29 action-time `ex.Message` raw-exception occurrences replaced with friendly copy (the client no longer leaks raw exception text anywhere). Next slice 54.3 (accessibility & keyboard-navigation regression) is Active.

*(Phases 32–53 complete — one-line ledger per phase in [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).)*

**Test policy for these phases (user-directed, binding):**

- **No new coded tests** — all verification is manual via MCP Playwright (live app, real browser).
- **Existing web tests (`tests/Iris.Web.Tests`) are expendable:** keep what passes; if a change breaks one, **delete that test** (log it in the change doc) — never fix the app to satisfy it, never write a replacement.
- **15-second rule:** any single test taking longer than 15 s is **skipped**; if the suite stalls on timing-out tests, use blame (detailed per-test timings) to find the offenders and **comment them out**.
- **Done = live-verified:** build clean + Docker rebuild + Playwright pass over the slice's scope + screenshots; broken/slow tests handled per the rules above.

## Active Slice

**54.4: Global error-boundary & circuit-disconnect pass** — Verify the Blazor global error UI (unhandled render exception) and the circuit-disconnect/reconnect messages never leak stack traces or raw exception text to users; friendly copy for unhandled render exceptions. Manual Playwright pass (force an unhandled exception / drop the circuit); no new coded tests per the binding WASM manual-test policy.

### Loop protocol (WASM manual-test phase)

Each slice is a **Playwright-driven pass**, not a code-first slice. Per slice:

1. **Build**: `cd /workspace && dotnet build apps/Iris.Web/Iris.Web.csproj -c Release`
2. **Docker**: `cd /workspace/apps/Iris.Web && docker compose build iris-web && docker compose up -d --force-recreate iris-web` — **avoid `--no-cache`** (repeated no-cache fills the host disk; if the build fails with `No space left on device`, run `docker builder prune -af` first).
3. **Manual test (MCP Playwright)**: create/use test accounts (`alice`/`alice-password` seeded; register more as the slice needs — `bob`, `carol`, `dave`), create test content (posts, replies, follows, communities, media, CW), exercise the slice's scope (see [docs/plans/wasm-stabilization.md](docs/plans/wasm-stabilization.md)). Capture **console errors** (`browser_console_messages`) and **screenshots of every screen** (inline screenshot no files) visited - use public fqdn address "https://iris.luit.ink".
4. **Triage**: log every defect (page, repro, expected vs actual, severity) in the slice's change doc; any defect not fixed this slice becomes a numbered **Up Next** item.
5. **Fix in scope**: implement fixes for the defects assigned to this slice; re-verify each fix live.
6. **Web tests**: `cd /workspace && dotnet test --no-build -c Release` — keep passing tests; **delete** any test broken by the change; **skip/comment out** any single test >15 s (find offenders via `dotnet test tests/Iris.Web.Tests -v n --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"` per-test timings). No new coded tests.
7. **Update PLAN.md**: move the finished slice to Recently Completed; keep Up Next sorted by priority (defects first).

## Up Next

Short, bounded list — only the next few items, not the whole roadmap. Defects triaged from test passes are prepended here (highest severity first).

**Phase 54 — Post-1.0 polish & hardening (in progress):**

1. **54.4: Global error-boundary & circuit-disconnect pass** — ACTIVE. Verify the Blazor global error UI and circuit-disconnect/reconnect messages never leak stack traces or raw exception text to users (continues the 54.2 `ex.Message` hardening at the app-shell level); friendly copy for unhandled render exceptions.
2. **54.5: Responsive regression at tablet/laptop breakpoints** — extend the 54.1 mobile pass (375px) to 768px and 1024px: verify no overflow/clipping on the dense pages (Settings cards, admin users/moderation tables, actor detail tabs).
3. **54.6: Search stale-results cosmetic** — during a re-search, the "Searching…" spinner renders while stale previous results remain visible below; hide the stale results (or show them dimmed) while a new search is in flight (noted in 54.2, deferred).

**Phase 45–52** (all COMPLETE — see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)).

## Inbox

User-injected requests that arrived mid-workstream. Actioned in order at the top of the *next* turn's "select the next work item" step, ahead of **Up Next** (unless a slice is already in progress — finish that first). Cleared once actioned; the resulting slice gets its own **Recently Completed** entry.

*(empty — Phase 31's 10 user-review items (2026-09-05) are all COMPLETE; see docs/changes/274–283.)*

## Paused Questions

Questions the agent asked and is waiting on a real answer for — the loop should not silently proceed past these. *(none currently)*

## Recently Completed

  - 54.3: **Accessibility & keyboard-navigation regression** (Phase 54) — verified the 47.3 ARIA pass held (icon labels, decorative SVGs, tab order all intact); fixed 3 defects: 14 pages missing `<h1>` (promoted page-title → `<h1>` + sub-sections up so no level skips), no visible keyboard focus (added high-contrast `:focus-visible` ring + removed `outline:none` on inputs), and action error/success not announced (added `role="alert"`/`role="status"` to all feedback elements). Live-verified via the Settings password flow. [changes/378](docs/changes/378-54.3-accessibility-keyboard-regression.md)
  - 54.2: **Empty-state & loading-state consistency audit** (Phase 54) — audited every paged-collection/actor/community/object page for deliberate empty+loading+error states (found already consistent — `PagedCollection` centralizes them; non-paged pages all have the four states); live-verified empty states (community feed/members, actor following, object replies). Replaced all 29 action-time `ex.Message` raw-exception occurrences with friendly copy — the WASM client no longer leaks raw exception text anywhere. [changes/377](docs/changes/377-54.2-empty-loading-state-audit.md)
  - 54.1: **Full manual Playwright regression pass** (Phase 54) — swept all pages live; fixed 5 defects: admin-page access (friendly access-denied + no raw JSON exception, via new `AdminGuard`), notification-verb misspelling ("flagged you" not "flaged"), mobile footer overflow (`flex-wrap`), `aria-pressed` explicit true/false, and outbox empty cards (shared `OutboxFilter` content-only). Load-time `ex.Message` → friendly copy (admin×4, Profile, CommunityDetail). [changes/376](docs/changes/376-54.1-playwright-regression-pass.md)
  - 53.9: **Branded WASM loading screen** (Phase 53) — replaced the bare "Loading…" text with a branded splash (pulsing logo + spinner + wordmark) using the app's design tokens. [changes/375](docs/changes/375-53.9-wasm-loading-screen.md)
  - 53.8: **Fix logout-on-refresh** (Phase 53) — INVESTIGATED: could not reproduce. `CookieAuthenticationStateProvider` correctly calls `/local/v1/session` on WASM startup; the auth cookie is persistent (`IsPersistent = true`). Live-verified: login → navigate → full page refresh → still authenticated. The bug was likely observed before the 53.4 post-login context race fix, or is environment-specific. No code change needed.
Rolling window of the last ~5 slices. When a new entry pushes this over 5, move the oldest entry's one-liner into [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)'s ledger and drop it here.

## Keeping the docs lean

- This file is the *only* one an agent must read and update every turn. Keep it short: bounded lists, not narrative.
- Detail belongs in [docs/plans/](docs/plans/) (forward-looking scope), [docs/changes/](docs/changes/README.md) (what was built), or [docs/decisions/](docs/decisions/README.md) (why). Link, don't copy.
- [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) is append-only and low-churn — add a line when a phase closes, don't rewrite it.

Full operating rules, including the Inbox and Paused-Questions protocols, live in [docs/reference/AUTONOMOUS_LOOP.md](docs/reference/AUTONOMOUS_LOOP.md).
